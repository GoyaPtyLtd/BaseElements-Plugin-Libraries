# BaseElements-Plugin-Libraries

This is a very messy start to a process to build the external libraries used in the BE plugin : https://github.com/GoyaPtyLtd/BaseElements-Plugin

This is a work in progres, and definitely not complete, but if you're interested in helping, we'd appreciated it : post an issue, or email me goya.com.au/contact

At some point I'll document how to use this.
